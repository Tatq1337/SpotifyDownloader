# SpotifyDownloader


Simple program to download tracks from specific playlist. Used Spotify API to get tracks name and names of artists of certain track. Tracks are downloaded in mp4 format using youtube_dl module. Everything here is made just for self-development purposes.

*if you dont have installed modules like youtube_dl for example you have to install it using pip



to use program you also have to fill gaps in code like CID, SECRET, and PLAYLIST_ID between the quotes.



please youtube dont sue me :/
